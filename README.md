  ## Installation
  The user should clone the repository from GitHub and install dependencies. For development or testing purposes, run `npm install` on both client and server directories to install dependencies. There are two servers for client side and server side, which can be run on their own. To run both servers at the same time, open the root directory and run `npm run develop`.

  Alternatively, use the deployed version at: https://guarded-anchorage-60502.herokuapp.com/login
